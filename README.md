Welcome to the Research Data Management (RDM) for Life Science Course! This course is designed to equip PhD candidates from the Faculty of Life Sciences and the Centre for Microbiology and Environmental Systems Science at the University of Vienna with the fundamental knowledge and practical skills required to manage research data effectively throughout its lifecycle.

## Description
The course is structured as a blended learning experience, combining online self-study modules created with [LiaScript](https://liascript.github.io/) and an in-person workshop (6 hours). It is specifically tailored for PhD candidates, but suitable for all beginners in research data management and covers the following topics:

* What is Research Data Management (RDM)?
* Data Management Plans
* Organizing your Data
* Documenting and Annotating your Data
* Storing and Securing your Data
* Publishing and Preserving your Data
* Ethical and Legal Aspects of RDM

## How to (Re-)Use the Course
The online modules are written in LiaScript, a Markdown dialect, making it convenient to customize them for your research institution. For assistance, please refer to the [LiaScript documentation](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaScript/docs/master/README.md#1). We advise to provide participants with the online course approximatly two weeks before the in-person workshop so that they can progress through the modules at their own pace. 

For a comprehensive guide on utilizing the materials for the in-person workshop, please consult the activities guide for detailed instructions. Additionally, it is feasible to deliver the workshop in an online format with some slight modifications.
